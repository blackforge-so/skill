  Answer crypto market-data questions with BlackForge. Use it whenever the user asks about spot
  order-book or trade data (latest stats, order-book depth, resting or pulled liquidity,
  taker buy-vs-sell volume, order-ladder rungs, price-level lifetime, trade timing, outsized
  trades, market-cap or attention enrichment) or about crypto futures and perpetual contracts
  (funding rates, open interest, mark and index price, basis against spot, taker flow,
  liquidations); when they want to pull, chart or compare a metric over a time range; or when they
  ask which pairs or contracts a venue lists. Covers the major spot exchanges (14,000+ pairs, 150+
  measurement columns per pair per closed minute) and the linear futures contracts on the major
  futures venues. Trigger even when BlackForge is not named but the question is about crypto
  market data on a venue. Drives the BlackForge MCP tools (blackforge_*, blackforge_futures_*) or
  the `blackforge` CLI, never the raw API. Every column is a measurement, not a trade call.

# BlackForge market-data

BlackForge is a **raw market-data** product: for every `(exchange, symbol)` it stores one wide row
per closed **minute** (one-minute rows; history before the switch to them is 5-minute rows),
**169 measurement columns** across 14,000+ spot pairs, served at `1m`, `5m`, `1h` and `1d` —
order-book depth, resting-liquidity dynamics, trade-flow and trade-timing measurements, plus
market-cap and attention enrichment, and a per-row quality bitmask. This skill lets you answer a
plain-language market-data question by calling BlackForge's own tools and reading the rows back
**as measurements**.

It also records the **linear futures contracts** (perpetual and dated) on the major futures venues:
prices, funding, open interest, taker flow and liquidations, one row per contract per minute. That
data has its own tools, catalog block and limits; see [Futures](#futures-funding-open-interest-basis-and-liquidations).

You are a thin orchestration + interpretation layer. **Never** build HTTP requests, curl the API,
or hardcode an endpoint URL. Always go through the MCP tools or the `blackforge` CLI. Your job is to
know the vocabulary (which metric answers which question), run the right call, and explain the
numbers correctly.

## What BlackForge is — and is not

It is a measurement feed. Each column has a precise definition (e.g. *"resting sell liquidity from
the best ask up to +100%"*, *"quote notional that left the bid side of the book"*, *"median
lifetime of a price level created and removed inside the window"*). Present results in exactly that
register: **a measurement with a definition and a unit**.

It describes what happened in the book and on the tape — it does not tell the user what will happen
next or what to trade. Do not describe any column, or the data as a whole, using the words **signal,
pump, anomaly, probability-scored, alpha, prediction, detection, or alert**, and do not imply
the data forecasts or recommends anything. Say what was *measured* ("bid depth within 5% fell from X
to Y"), not what it *means for a trade*. This framing is the whole point of the skill.

**Where the line falls.** If the question contains a real market-data question wearing trading
clothes — "is there a big sell wall on DOGE, should I be worried?" — hold the framing and answer
with the measurement. But a request for a **recommendation with no data question inside it**
("should I buy ETH right now?") is **not** a BlackForge question: do not trigger on it, and do not
reach for market data to dress up an answer. Say plainly that you do not give trade advice, and
offer to show what the book and the tape actually measured if that would help.

("Flag" is the one exception, and only in its literal sense: `qualityFlags` is a real column and a
flagged *bucket* is a statement about data quality, never about the market.)

Also: never propose narrowing the venue or coin universe to save cost — the full universe is the
product.

**Live formulas** (a user's own measure computed every second from the live book and tape, across venues, with a notification when it crosses a value they set) are an Ultra feature this skill does not drive: point the user to the BlackForge agent at https://app.blackforge.so/chat or the `/v1/formulas` API; this skill reads closed windows only.

## The playbook: discover → pick → call → interpret

### 1. Discover first — never guess identifiers

Before any keyed query, call **`blackforge_catalog`** (CLI: `blackforge catalog`). It is keyless and
returns the 9 venues (each with its `minPlan`) and all 169 metrics with `key`, `label`, `unit`,
`family`, `description`, `howToRead` and `minPlan`. Use it to resolve:

- the exact **`exchange`** identifier (lowercase: `binance`, `okx`, …), and
- the exact **`metric`** key the user's words map to (e.g. "resting depth"/"sell wall"/"pulled
  liquidity" → the right `downDepth*` / `upDepth*` / `bidLiqRemoved` … key).

  **Some words have no key.** There is no spread column — the catalog has `bestBid` and `bestAsk`,
  and a spread is something YOU derive from two `blackforge_series` calls. When the catalog has no
  key for what was asked, say so and offer what it does measure. Never answer a spread question
  with a depth number: depth is resting size, not the distance between the two sides.

Never invent a metric key or a venue name. If you already hold a recent catalog in the conversation
you may reuse it, but when unsure, re-fetch — it is cheap and keyless. For a compact index of every
metric grouped by family with its one-line measurement definition, read
[`references/metrics-glossary.md`](references/metrics-glossary.md); the live catalog wording is
canonical when they differ.

To list the pairs a venue trades, call **`blackforge_symbols({exchange})`**
(CLI: `blackforge symbols --exchange <v>`). Symbol format is the venue's own
(`BTCUSDT` on binance, `BTC-USDT` on okx/coinbase) — confirm via symbols rather than assuming.

### 2. Pick the right tool for the shape of the question

| The user wants… | Call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| a coin's **latest** stats on a venue (one snapshot) | `blackforge_latest({exchange, symbol, columns?})` | returns `{ ts, values }` for the last complete bucket **at the caller's plan granularity** — **`1m` on ultra and payg** (the 5-minute record until that venue's one-minute rows exist), `5m` on max, **`1h` on pro, `1d` on free**. On the coarser tiers `ts` is the bucket start, so a free key's "latest" can be a day old. Nothing in the response says which granularity you got, so state the bucket length you are reading. Pass `columns` (metric keys) to keep the answer focused; omit for the full row. |
| how a metric **moved over a time range** | `blackforge_series({exchange, symbol, metric, from, to, interval})` | returns `{ points: [{ ts, value }] }`, `ts` in epoch ms. One metric per call. |
| **which pairs** a venue lists | `blackforge_symbols({exchange})` | |
| **usage / quota** left | `blackforge_usage()` | recent daily usage + rows remaining this month. |

CLI fallback maps 1:1: `blackforge latest …`, `blackforge series …`, `blackforge symbols …`,
`blackforge usage`. Prefer `--output json` when you will parse the result.

**Choosing `interval` for a series.** The only valid values are **`1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`** — anything
else 400s. The interval is **plan-gated as well as size-gated**: asking finer than your plan's floor
returns a **403**, not fewer points. **`1m` is ultra and payg only (payg bills a 1m row at 5x a 5m
row); `max` floors at `5m`; `pro` at `1h`; `free` at `1d`.** Pick the coarsest interval that answers
the question, and on a 403 step one rung coarser (`1m` → `5m` → `1h` → `1d`) rather than reporting
no data. **`1m` rows only exist from the switch to one-minute rows on** (`availableFrom["1m"]` in
`blackforge_catalog`; null means not yet): a `1m` series over an earlier range comes back empty, so
use `5m` there, which covers all history. Guard the 50k-point cap — points ≈ span ÷ interval; when a
range holds more, the response keeps the NEWEST buckets and says `truncated: true`:

- an hour or two, minute by minute → `1m` on ultra/payg (50k points ≈ 34 days at `1m`)
- hours to a few days → `5m` on max/ultra/payg · `1h` on pro · `1d` on free
- about a week to a month → `1h` on max/ultra and pro · `1d` on free
- multiple months → `1d` (every plan)

`from`/`to` are ISO-8601 UTC. If the user says "last week", compute the range from today and state
the window you used. If a single call would exceed ~50k points, widen the interval or split the range.

### 3. Interpret the rows as measurements

When you present numbers, define each column with its catalog `description` / `howToRead` wording
(or the glossary). Convert quote-relative values to USD when helpful by multiplying by
`quoteUsdRate` (units are documented per metric). Anchor `ts` on the timeline. Compare windows in
plain measurement terms — "taker-buy volume was 2.3× taker-sell volume", "median resting-level
lifetime dropped from 4.1s to 0.6s" — and stop there. Do not translate a measurement into a buy/sell
call or label it with any banned word.

**Rollup notes.** The rows are measured per minute; `5m`, `1h` and `1d` are rollups of them (sums
for flows, last value for book state, count-weighted means for trade averages). For most columns the
`5m` rollup equals what a native 5-minute measurement would read. About three dozen do not, because
they are measured within each minute (the 19 strong-trade columns against a trailing five-minute
mean, liquidity removed, mirrored pairs, level flicker and lifetime, equal-size groups, the trade-gap
mode, the 10 s / 60 s rise and drop). Those carry a one-sentence `rollupNote` in `blackforge_catalog`;
when you report one at `5m` or coarser, say how it was rolled up, and do not compare its level across
the switch to one-minute rows as if nothing changed.

**Always read `qualityFlags`.** It is the one column that qualifies every other column on the row,
it is free on every plan, and it is deliberately queryable — request it alongside whatever else you
ask for. It is a **bitmask**: `0` means no known problem, and each set bit names one condition. The
full bit table ships on the catalog entry for `qualityFlags` as `bits`, and each bit carries a
`contaminates` list of the metric families it calls into question — so a broken order book leaves
the trade columns on the same row sound. Read the bit table from the catalog rather than hardcoding
bit numbers.

Nothing measured in a row is ever hidden, filtered or adjusted. Every value is exactly as measured;
the flags tell you which of them to trust. The one thing never served is a placeholder: a column a
row did not measure at all is `null`. Two companion columns are worth requesting with it:

- **`lastTradeAgeTime`** — how long before the window closed the pair last traded, `0` when the
  window itself contained a trade. About half of all windows contain no trade, and their candle
  carries the last traded price forward rather than inventing one. A large value means the price is
  real but old.
- **`bookObservedAt`**: the instant on our clock that the row's order book describes. From each
  venue's date in `availableFrom.bookOnBoundary` (`blackforge_catalog`; null means not yet) the
  book is read as it stood at the window end, so `bookObservedAt` equals `ts` and two venues line
  up at the same `ts`. A row where it is later than `ts` (every earlier row) read the book late by
  the difference, by a different amount on each venue, so do not compare depth or best bid and ask
  across venues on such rows as if they were simultaneous. The book event columns (liquidity added
  and removed, level changes, flicker, lifetimes) follow the same switch: on boundary rows they
  cover the same window as the trades. The order book columns carry a one-sentence
  `bookTimingNote` in `blackforge_catalog` saying so.

**The `QUALITY_UNKNOWN` flag (mask 32768) is not a defect.** It means the row predates the quality
rail and was never assessed — **unchecked, not unreliable**. It is the ClickHouse column default, so
the entire pre-migration-006 archive carries it. Say "not assessed", never "bad data".

**`BOOK_EMPTY_AT_VENUE` (mask 131072) is not a defect either.** The venue itself publishes no order
book for the pair, so the empty book (it always comes with `BOOK_EMPTY`) is a fact about the venue.
Say "the venue quotes no book for this pair", never "the book was lost".

**`TRADES_BACKFILLED` (mask 262144)** marks a window rebuilt later from the venue's public trade
archive because the live window was lost. Its trade columns are real measurements; its book,
enrichment and context columns come back `null`, and coarser buckets (1h, 1d) average only the
windows that measured them. Report the trade figures and say the book was not observed then.

Where a chart draws this, the convention is: **wherever the mark is fainter or hollow, that bucket
is flagged; solid means final.**

**Five columns that 400 the WHOLE request if you name them in `columns=`.** `quoteAsset`,
`baseAsset`, `enrichmentTs`, `bookSynced` and `missingTrades` are identity/state fields, not data
series. Naming any one of them fails the entire call — the columns you actually wanted included —
with `Unknown metric(s): …`. They arrive on their own in a full response; just never ask for them
by name. Use `qualityFlags` for the `bookSynced` / `missingTrades` concerns.

`bookAgeTime` and `seedDepth` are the opposite case: `internal: true`, they measure our collector
rather than the market, and the API **accepts-and-ignores** them, as it does the structural keys
`ts`, `exchange`, `symbol` and `ingestedAt`. Requesting those six is harmless.

### 4. Handle entitlements gracefully — omitted ≠ nonexistent

Entitlements (venues, columns, granularity, history depth) are enforced **server-side by plan**.
Three things to recognise and explain:

- A response header **`X-BlackForge-Columns-Omitted`** (or simply missing expected columns) means
  those columns sit **above the caller's plan** and were dropped — the data exists, the key just
  doesn't include it. Tell the user which tier includes them and point to **blackforge.so/pricing**.
  Never report it as "there is no data for that".
- A **`403`** on a venue or interval means the same at the request level (e.g. a `pro`-only venue on
  a free key, or a `5m` interval on a pro key, whose floor is `1h`, or `1m` on a max key). Explain
  the plan gap and the upgrade path (`1m` is ultra and payg).
- **History depth is clamped SILENTLY — there is no header and no error.** If you ask for a `from`
  earlier than the plan's window, the API quietly moves it forward to the plan's floor and returns
  a shorter `points` array. Nothing in the response says it happened, so a short series is
  ambiguous: it may be the plan's window, not the end of the data.

  **Never narrate this as retention.** "BlackForge only has data going back two weeks" is wrong and
  is the single easiest mistake to make here. **Retention is infinite — nothing is ever deleted.**
  (That is the spot archive. Futures are the one exception: see the futures history below.)
  The window is an *entitlement*: how far back this key may read. Compare the first timestamp you
  got against the `from` you asked for, and when it moved, say so — "your plan reads back 2 weeks,
  so the series starts there; the archive itself goes back further" — then point at
  **blackforge.so/pricing**.

`blackforge_usage` / `X-BlackForge-Rows-Remaining` tell you the monthly quota left; if a call fails
for quota, say so plainly.

### 5. Prefer MCP, fall back to CLI, else help them set up

1. If the **`blackforge_*` MCP tools** are available, use them — this is the primary path.
2. Otherwise, if the **`blackforge` CLI** is installed (or `npx -y @blackforge-so/cli` is usable), shell
   out to it and parse `--output json`.
3. If neither exists, don't hand-roll API calls — tell the user how to set one up and point them to
   [`references/setup.md`](references/setup.md) (MCP config block, CLI install, and where to get a
   key at app.blackforge.so → API).

## Futures: funding, open interest, basis and liquidations

The futures data is a separate table: one row per **linear futures contract** (perpetual or dated,
quoted and margined in its quote currency; coin-margined contracts are not recorded) per closed
minute, on binance, bitget, bybit, gate, kucoin, mexc and okx. It has its own tools, its own catalog
block, its own quality bits and its own history window. Everything in the spot playbook above about
framing (measurements, never calls), omitted columns and 403s applies here too.

### Discover

`blackforge_catalog` (CLI `blackforge catalog --futures`) carries a `futures` block: `venues` (each
with its `minPlan` and its `liquidations` coverage), `metrics` (each with `key`, `unit`, `family`,
`rollup`, `minPlan`, and `nullOn` for venues where it is always null), `qualityBits` (the futures
flag table), `liquidationEvents` (the plan the event feed needs), `availableFrom` and `historyDays`.
[`references/futures-glossary.md`](references/futures-glossary.md) indexes every futures column.

**Contracts are spelled the venue's way**: binance, bybit and bitget `BTCUSDT`; okx `BTC-USDT-SWAP`;
gate and mexc `BTC_USDT`; kucoin `XBTUSDTM`; dated contracts carry the expiry (`BTCUSDT_261225`,
`BTCUSDT-25DEC26`). List them with `blackforge_futures_symbols({exchange})`. To find the same coin on
every venue, use `baseAsset` (normalised: kucoin XBT reads BTC), never string surgery on symbols.

### Pick the tool

| The user wants… | Call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| a contract's **latest** funding, open interest or prices | `blackforge_futures_latest({exchange, symbol, columns?})` | last complete bucket at the plan's interval; the response names its `interval`. Text columns (`baseAsset`, `quoteAsset`, `contractType`) come back as strings. |
| how funding, open interest, volume or liquidations **moved** | `blackforge_futures_series({exchange, symbol, metric, from, to, interval})` | numeric columns only; same 50k-point cap and `truncated` flag as spot. Flows are summed into a bucket; prices, funding and open interest are the bucket's last minute. |
| the **same coin across venues**, or the highest/lowest values on a venue | `blackforge_futures_top({metric, baseAsset?, exchange?, contractType?, order?, limit?})` | ranks contracts on the latest complete bucket; `baseAsset:'BTC'` with no `exchange` is the cross-venue table. `limit` up to 100. |
| individual **liquidation events** | `blackforge_futures_liquidations({exchange?, symbol?, side?, from?, to?, limit?})` | newest first, last hour by default, `limit` up to 1000. Max, Ultra and PAYG only. |
| which contracts a venue lists | `blackforge_futures_symbols({exchange})` | not metered. |

CLI fallback: `blackforge futures latest|series|top|liquidations|symbols` with the same parameters
(`--base-asset`, `--contract-type`, `--side`, `--limit`), `--output json` to parse.

### Plans and history

| plan | futures venues | finest interval | history | liquidation columns and events |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| free | binance, gate, mexc | `1d` | last 14 days | no |
| pro | all | `1h` | rolling 60 days | no |
| max | all | `5m` | rolling 60 days | yes |
| ultra, payg | all | `1m` | rolling 60 days | yes |

The `minPlan` fields in the futures catalog are canonical if this table ever disagrees. A venue
outside the plan, an interval finer than the floor, a ranking on a liquidation column below Max and
the event feed below Max are each a **403** with an upgrade URL; a liquidation column in
`futures_latest` or `futures_series` below Max is dropped and named in `columnsOmitted`.

**Futures history IS retention.** Futures rows are kept for a rolling 60 days, from
7 November 2026 (`historyDays`, `availableFrom`); older ones are deleted. So unlike spot, a futures
series that starts later than asked may have hit the end of the data, not only the plan's window
(Free reads 14 days). A `from` before the window is moved forward silently. Compare the first `ts`
with `availableFrom` and the plan's window and say which one cut it. Never call it a full archive.

### Read the columns honestly

- **Funding.** `fundingRate` is a fraction for ONE funding interval (`0.0001` = 0.01%); positive means
  longs pay shorts. Venues and contracts settle at different intervals (1 h, 4 h or 8 h): the step
  between successive `nextFundingTime` values is the interval. Before comparing rates across venues,
  either compare like intervals or convert, and say which you did. `predictedFundingRate` is the
  venue's own published estimate of the next rate and is null on venues that publish none
  (`nullOn`). Dated contracts carry no funding (null).
- **Open interest.** `openInterest` is in coins, `openInterestValue` in the quote currency; compare
  venues on `openInterestValue`. On binance the value can be a few minutes old: read
  `openInterestAt`, and the `OI_STALE` flag marks reads older than 10 minutes.
- **Basis.** Two measurements, say which one you report. The venue's own premium: `markPrice` against
  `indexPrice` on the same futures row (the index is the venue's spot reference). Against BlackForge
  spot: the futures `markPrice` (or `lastPrice`) against the spot `price` of the same coin on the same
  venue, at the same `ts` and `interval` (both label buckets the same way), as
  `(futures / spot - 1) × 10,000` bps. The spot pair has its own symbol (okx `BTC-USDT` against
  `BTC-USDT-SWAP`, kucoin `BTC-USDT` against `XBTUSDTM`): resolve it with `blackforge_symbols`. The two
  are read in the same minute, not the same millisecond, and each side needs its venue in the plan.
- **Taker flow.** `takerBuyVolume / volume` is the taker buy share; `volume - takerBuyVolume` is the
  taker sell volume. Same in quote units with the `Quote` columns.
- **Liquidations.** `side` is the POSITION liquidated: a long is closed by a forced sell, a short by a
  forced buy. Coverage is per venue in `futures.venues[].liquidations`: `complete` (every event),
  `lowerBound` (the venue throttles its feed, so a cascade is undercounted) or null (no feed: the
  liquidation columns are null there). Any total that includes a lower-bound venue is "at least".
  okx also delivers part of its feed minutes late, so its event feed holds liquidations its minute
  columns do not. `blackforge_futures_liquidations` names the lower-bound venues in a result in its
  `feedNote`.
- **Quality.** Futures rows have their OWN flag table (`futures.qualityBits`), not the spot bits: the
  same bit number means a different thing. `QUOTE_MISSING` (no snapshot that minute: prices, funding
  and open interest null), `TRADES_PARTIAL` (volume and counts are lower bounds, the first minute
  after a reconnect), `LIQ_PARTIAL`, `OI_STALE`, `BAR_NOT_FINAL`. Name the flag, never the number, and
  read `qualityFlags` before trusting an unusual value.

### Futures worked examples

**"What's BTC funding across exchanges right now?"**
→ `blackforge_futures_top({metric:'fundingRate', baseAsset:'BTC', contractType:'perpetual'})` →
report each venue's rate as a percentage per its own interval (`0.0001` → 0.01% per interval), state
the bucket `ts`, and say the intervals differ before ranking them against each other (read
`nextFundingTime` on the contracts you compare).

**"How has ETH open interest on Binance changed over the last three days?"**
→ `blackforge_futures_series({exchange:'binance', symbol:'ETHUSDT', metric:'openInterestValue',
from, to, interval:'1h'})` (a free key gets `1d`) → report the change in the quote currency as a
measured quantity, with the window and interval used; check `qualitySummary` for `OI_STALE`.

**"What's the basis between the BTC perp and spot on OKX?"**
→ `blackforge_futures_latest({exchange:'okx', symbol:'BTC-USDT-SWAP', columns:['markPrice','indexPrice']})`
and `blackforge_latest({exchange:'okx', symbol:'BTC-USDT', columns:['price']})` at the same `ts` (or
two series at the same interval for a history) → report the premium over the venue index and over
BlackForge spot in bps, and say they are read in the same minute.

**"Show me the biggest liquidations in the last hour."**
→ `blackforge_futures_liquidations({limit:1000})` (Max and up) → sort the events by `notional`
yourself (the feed is newest first), report side as the position liquidated, and carry the
`feedNote` caveat: on lower-bound venues the list is incomplete. If `truncated` is true, narrow the
window and say so.

## Worked examples

**"What's the resting depth for ETH on Binance right now?"**
→ `blackforge_catalog` to confirm `binance` and the depth metric keys → `blackforge_symbols` if
unsure of the symbol (`ETHUSDT`) → `blackforge_latest({exchange:'binance', symbol:'ETHUSDT',
columns:['price','downDepth5','downDepth10','upDepth30','upDepth100','qualityFlags']})`. Report each as its
measurement: "bid depth within −5% of top-of-book: \$X; ask depth to +30%: \$Y", noting they are
resting-liquidity sums in the quote currency at the last complete bucket for that key's plan
(1 min on ultra/payg, 5 min on max, 1 h on pro, 1 d on free), and reading `qualityFlags` before trusting them.

**"Chart the bid-ask spread for BTC-USDT on OKX last week."**
→ catalog — **there is no spread key.** Say so, then derive it: two `blackforge_series` calls
(`bestAsk` and `bestBid`) over the same range and subtract point by point. Use `interval:'1h'` for a
week (it is inside every paid plan's floor and reads cleanly; `5m` needs max or above and `1m`
ultra/payg; a free key gets `1d`). State the window and the interval
you actually used, and describe the line as the measured quantity over time, not as a trade cue.

**"Compare taker buy vs sell volume for SOL on Binance today."**
→ two `blackforge_series` calls (`buyTradeVol`, `sellTradeVol`) or one `blackforge_latest` with both
columns → present the ratio as measured aggressor balance.
